# Tanzania-Tourism-Prediction

## Aim

The primary goal of this hackathon was to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying the expenditure ranges of tourists visiting Tanzania. This model is designed to assist tour operators and the Tanzania Tourism Board in estimating tourists' expenditures, offering valuable insights for better planning and decision-making.

## Importance of the Challenge

1. Enhancing the Tourism Sector: By accurately classifying tourist expenditures, we can improve tourism services, benefiting both visitors and the Tanzanian economy.

2. Facilitating Planning and Estimation: The model helps in automatically estimating tourist expenditures, aiding in planning and budgeting for tourists and tourism-related organizations alike.

3. Promoting Global Tourism: This model provides a useful tool for tourists worldwide, enabling them to estimate their potential expenditures when planning a trip to Tanzania.

## Technologies Used

1. Python: We utilized Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models.

2. Machine Learning Classification Models: Various classification algorithms were explored and implemented to predict expenditure ranges accurately.

3. Data Analysis: Tools like Pandas and NumPy were employed for data manipulation and analysis, ensuring that the data was thoroughly examined and processed correctly.
