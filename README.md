# Tanzania-Tourism-Prediction Challenge

## Title: Tanzania-Tourism-Prediction

## Aim

The objective of this hackathon is to develop a machine learning model to predict what a tourist will spend when visiting Tanzania.The model can be used by different tour operators and the Tanzania Tourism Board to automatically help tourists across the world estimate their expenditure before visiting Tanzania.

## Importance of the Challenge

1. Enhancing the Tourism Sector: By accurately classifying tourist expenditures, we can improve tourism services, benefiting both visitors and the Tanzanian economy.

2. Facilitating Planning and Estimation: The model helps in automatically estimating tourist expenditures, aiding in planning and budgeting for tourists.

3. Promoting Global Tourism: This model provides a useful tool for tourists worldwide, enabling them to estimate their potential expenditures when planning a trip to Tanzania.

## Technologies Used

1. Python: I utilized Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models.

2. Data Analysis: Tools like Pandas,NumPy, Matplotlib,Seaborn were employed for data manipulation and analysis, ensuring that the data was thoroughly examined and processed correctly.

3. Machine Learning Models: Various regression algorithms were explored and implemented to predict expenditure ranges accurately.
